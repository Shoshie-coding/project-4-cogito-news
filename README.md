## **About this project**
## You can view the live website [here](https://cogito-ergo-sum.onrender.com/)

This is a full stack website build uinsg Django, Python, Postgres SQL, Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
This project allows users to sign up and login to the website, create their own posts and chose a categpry for their posts. Users are also able to read and like posts from other users. I've implemented a news API so that users can view news around the world based on 4 categories: Arts and Culture, Technology, Movies and Music and Travel. 
This website is for all those who are interested in the categories oulined above and who want to discover news from around the world at the same time as reading blogs written by users. 

## **UX design**
In building this website, I've followed the principles of UX design and implemented features that are responsive, are visually pleasing and overall create a good experience for the User.

## **User Stories**
The following User Stories have been used to organise and create this project

- **As a Site User I can like posts so that I can show my appreciation for the post**

## Main Features and respective manual testing

I used the MVP model on my website. I have used a mix of Simple Tests in Django for the main features and manual testing for all features. 

- **Header image and Navigation Bar** 
Designed mainly using Bootstrap and CSS, the navbar is responsive on all devices, featuring a collapsible menu and a hamburger style menu on smaller devices like tablets and phones.
You can navigate from the navbar to all the main pages on the website. 
When User is not logged in, they will see options to Sign in and Register.

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)

#### **Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used**

1. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import fonts 'Quattrocento Sans' and 'Ovo' that are used throughout the website. 
2. [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/mythemes) was used to extract the colors used on the website. 
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used to used to edit the code on the Gitpod terminal, to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
4. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used to store the project code after being pushed from Git. 
5. [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) is used to deploy the website
6. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is used to store the media files


## Testing

### Validator testing 
### HTML 
All the below pages don't have any errors or issues
- Home page
![HTML Home](static/images/home-html.png)
- News and blogs page
![HTML Home](static/images/html-news-blogs.png)

- Post detail page
![Post detail page](static/images/html-post-detail.png)

- Create post page
![HTML Validator](static/images/html-create-post.png)

- My posts
I validated this page by right-click - page source. Go to validator and use direct input 
![HTML Validator](static/images/html-myposts.png)


- Logout page 
![HTML Validator](static/images/html-logout.png)
- Login page
![HTML Validator](static/images/html-login.png)
- Sign-up page
![HTML Validator](static/images/html-signup.png)


### Known Limitations
I've added [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to news and blogs page to bring up news from various source. I'm using a developper account so i am limited to 100 times per day to refresh the page.
This is enough for testing purposes, however it will throw a server error if the limit is reached. I can refresh the API key if the limit is reached. 


### CSS
All CSS validations were without errors.

![CSS Validator](static/images/css-validator.png)

### Javascript 
I had a few warnings only when validating the Javascript

### Python
- Python code was validated using [Pep8 validator online](http://pep8online.com/).
- All the results returned without errors.
- Before using the pep8 validator I ran autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive --recursive . 

- The only error I found was in settings.py with AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS & STATICFILES_STORAGE.
![Pep8](static/images/pep8-settings.png)


- There are some suggested resolves for this here [Django](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28163). It seems like according to Django shortening these lines is not advisable. This is why I decided to leave these lines as they are.

Test results can be found here[here](Pep8-results)


#### Lighthouse report
The website passed the Lighthouse report for all pages

## **Deployment**

This project was deployed using Github and Heroku

### Create a repository on Github
You can create a repository on Github using these instructions [Creating a new repository - Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)


### Deployment on Heroku

I followed Code Institute's [Django Blog Cheat Sheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf) steps to create and deploy the project on Heroku 


This project was deployed on Heroku using these steps:

1. Install Django and supporting libraries
2. Log in to Heroku and create a new app.
3. Attach the heroku-postgres add-on
4. Prepare environment and settings.py file
5. Get the static and media files stored on Cloudinary
6. Complete the config vars section
7. Link Heroku and GitHub accounts together
8. Select the Github repo that you use for the app and give it a name
9. Before the final Deployement: Remove the "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC" from Heroku Config vars, and Change Debug to "False" in settings.py
10. Click on deploy.


### Clone a Github repository using these steps:
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click the Code button.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the clone symbol. To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the clone symbol next to it. To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the same clone symbol .
4. Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
